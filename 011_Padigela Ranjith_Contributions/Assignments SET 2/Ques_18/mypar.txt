An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. 
In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal. My aim in life is to be a 
teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that 
the ever-increasing misery and distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy 
of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread education among the masses 
as much as possible within my humble power.

As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart man-making education. 
Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. 
Rather, I think that morality is the real honey of life. 
I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.
