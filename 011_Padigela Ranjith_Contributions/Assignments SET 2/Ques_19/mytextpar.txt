that helps to maintain or improve overall health. We should consume a balanced 
diet consisting of essential nutrition: liquids, adequate proteins, essential fatty 
acids, vitamins, minerals, and calories. We must eat fresh fruits, salad, green leafy 
vegetables, milk, egg, yoghurt, etc. on time in order to maintain a healthy body. 
Among the minerals, we require chiefly iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and small 
quantities of iodine, copper, etc. Milk is perhaps the only single item that can be 
called a balanced diet in itself.
